Build a backend for an Attendance Tracking App using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.

Roles and Authentication:
Implement separate login systems (using JWT) for the following user roles:

Admin

Teacher

Student (students don’t log in, they just view attendance by inputting name or roll number)

Features by Role:
🛠️ Admin:
Add/view/edit/delete:

Teachers

Students

Classes

Upload teacher/student data via CSV 

Assign students to classes

Assign teachers to classes

Mark attendance for students in any class (present/absent per date)

View all attendance data

🧑‍🏫 Teacher:
Can only mark attendance for students in the classes assigned to them

Can view attendance records of their classes

👨‍🎓 Student:
No login required

Can view their own attendance by entering either:

Name

Roll Number

Additional Notes:
Each class contains multiple students.

Attendance should be tracked by date per student, per class.

Use MongoDB models for:

Users (with role-based permissions)

Students

Teachers

Classes

Attendance (date, studentId, classId, status)

Optional Enhancements:
Pagination and filtering for attendance records

Rate limiting for student view to prevent scraping

Export attendance to CSV
